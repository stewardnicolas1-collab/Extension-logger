1. click index.js and you'll see something that says const webhook = ""
2. now make a discord webhook and put your webhook in the " thingy like this for example | const webhook = "Webhook url"
3. and go to manifest.json and edit the name, description, and version | optional
4. now download manifest.json and index.js and put them in a folder
